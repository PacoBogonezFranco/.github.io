            This course is an elegible course of <a class="Biomedical" href="https://www.upc.edu/en/bachelors/biomedical-engineering-barcelona-eebe">Bachelor's Degree in Biomedical 
            Engineering</a>, taught in  <a class="EEBE" href="https://eebe.upc.edu/en/degrees?set_language=en">Barcelona East School of Engineering</a> (EEBE). 
          </p>
          <p>
            It is focused on real life applications of medical wearable devices and the technology associated with them. Students are guided through 
            the processes used in the medical industry to develop medical wearable devices. At the end of the course, students will have developed a 
            proof-of-concept wearable medical device.
          </p>
          <p>
            To develop the medical wearable device we use the Arduino Nano 33 IoT board with a custom sensor board. Arduino Nano 33 IoT has an accelerometer and gyroscope. Sensor 
            board contains a pressure and humidity sensor (BME280), a biopotential amplifier with a bandwidth of 1 kHz (suitable for EMG measurements), a pulse oximeter and heart
            rate sensor (MAX30101) and an integrated biopotential ECG chip (MAX30003).

            First time this couse was taught was on September 2020.
